          <h2>Welcome to a site about Mitch Hedberg</h2>
          <p>You will want to memorize a number of quotes by the one and only Mitch.</p>
          <p>Here are some good ones to start with:</p>
          <p>I'm sick of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they're goin', and hook up with them later.</p>
          <p>It's very dangerous to wave to people you don't know because what if they don't have hands? They'll think you're cocky.</p>
          <p>If carrots got you drunk, rabbits would be messed-up.</p>

          <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
          <p>Mitch was hilarious.</p>
          <p>"Hedberg's standup comedy was distinguished by the unique manner of speech he adopted later in his career, his abrupt delivery, and his unusual stage presence." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg">wikipedia</a>)</p>
          <p>On March 30, 2005, Hedberg was found dead in a hotel room in Livingston, New Jersey.[12] He was 37 years old.</p>
